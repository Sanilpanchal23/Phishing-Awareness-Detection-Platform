An **interactive, single-page web application** designed to educate users on phishing attacks by simulating a realistic scenario — from the initial bait through to post-breach analysis.

This project provides a **safe, hands-on learning environment** to tackle one of the most common cyberattack vectors.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Realistic Phishing Simulation** – Fake corporate login page with deceptive URL and mimicked browser UI.
* **Immediate Feedback** – Real-time credential exfiltration animation.
* **Educational Debrief** – Explains phishing red flags (spelling errors, URL tricks, urgency).
* **Campaign Dashboard** – Visualises KPIs (compromise rates, live activity feed).
* **Fully Self-contained** – Runs entirely in a single static file.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

* **HTML5** – Core structure and content.
* **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first styling for rapid, responsive design.
* **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Interactive simulation logic, DOM manipulation, state management.

## 📚 Core Concepts & Skills Demonstrated

### 🔐 Cybersecurity Awareness

* **Social Engineering** – Psychological manipulation (urgency, authority, fear).
* **Phishing Analysis** – Spotting red flags (domain spoofing, spelling mistakes).
* **Threat Visualisation** – Making abstract cyber risks tangible.
* **Security Education** – Strengthening organisational security posture.

### 🎨 Frontend Development & UX

* **DOM Manipulation** – Seamless navigation without reloads.
* **State Management** – Tracking simulation results dynamically.
* **Animations** – Fluid CSS transitions and theft visualisation.
* **Responsive Design** – Optimised for desktop, tablet, and mobile.
* **User Journey Mapping** – Logical flow from bait → decision → lesson → dashboard.

---

## 🔎 How It Works

1. **The Bait** – User is shown a fake login page.
2. **The Decision** – User either:

   * Submits credentials → theft animation plays.
   * Reports the page → flagged as safe behaviour.
3. **The Lesson** – Mistakes highlighted in an educational breakdown.
4. **The Analysis** – Dashboard records outcome (compromised or reported).

## 💻 Local Development

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/phishing-awareness-platform.git
```

Navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd phishing-awareness-platform
```

Open in your browser:

```bash
index.html
```

💡 For best results, use a live server extension in your code editor.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

* 🔄 **Multiple Campaign Templates** – Parcel delivery, HMRC tax rebate, etc.
* 🏆 **User Scoring System** – Gamify training through scores & leaderboards.
* ☁️ **Backend Integration** – Persist campaign results with Node.js + PostgreSQL.
