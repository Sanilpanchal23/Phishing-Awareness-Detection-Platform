Got it! I’ve rewritten your **Phishing Awareness & Detection Platform README** to the same professional, portfolio-ready standard as your other projects — no preview GIF, but full structure, badges, screenshots table, and clean sections.

**Phishing Awareness & Detection Platform** is an **interactive, single-page web application** designed to educate users on phishing attacks by simulating a realistic scenario — from the initial bait through to post-breach analysis.

It provides a **safe, hands-on learning environment** to understand one of the most common cyberattack vectors.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Realistic Phishing Simulation** – Fake corporate login page with deceptive URL and mimicked browser UI
* **Immediate Feedback** – Real-time credential exfiltration animation
* **Educational Debrief** – Explains phishing red flags (spelling errors, URL tricks, urgency)
* **Campaign Dashboard** – Visualises KPIs (compromise rates, live activity feed)
* **Fully Self-contained** – Runs entirely in a single static file

---

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

* **HTML5** – Core structure and content
* **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first, responsive styling
* **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Simulation logic, DOM manipulation, state management
* **Google Fonts & SVG Icons** – Typography and interface visuals

---

## 📚 Core Concepts & Skills Demonstrated

### 🔐 Cybersecurity Awareness

* **Social Engineering** – Psychological manipulation: urgency, authority, fear
* **Phishing Analysis** – Spot domain spoofing, spelling errors, deceptive URLs
* **Threat Visualisation** – Making abstract cyber risks tangible
* **Security Education** – Strengthen organisational security posture

### 🎨 Frontend Development & UX

* **DOM Manipulation** – Seamless navigation without page reloads
* **State Management** – Track simulation results dynamically
* **Animations** – Fluid CSS transitions and credential theft visualisation
* **Responsive Design** – Optimised for desktop, tablet, and mobile
* **User Journey Mapping** – Logical flow from bait → decision → lesson → dashboard

---

## 🔎 How It Works

1. **The Bait** – User sees a fake login page
2. **The Decision** – User either:

   * Submits credentials → theft animation plays
   * Reports the page → flagged as safe behaviour
3. **The Lesson** – Educational breakdown of mistakes or safe actions
4. **The Analysis** – Dashboard records outcomes and KPIs

---

## 💻 Local Development

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/phishing-awareness-platform.git
cd phishing-awareness-platform
```

Open the project in your browser:

```bash
index.html
```

💡 For best results, use a **live server extension** in your code editor.

I can also **prepare a unified “assets/cover.png” banner** for this project so it matches your **Cloud Architect Pro, CTI Dashboard, Azure Intelligent Overview, and SQL Injection Experience** style.

Do you want me to create that banner too?
